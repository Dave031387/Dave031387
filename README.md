- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dave031387
- 👀 I’m interested in hobbyist programming in C#. My latest endeavor is a set of class libraries for processing text templates and generating wrappers for model classes to be used in view models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning WPF, XAML, MVVM, and related topics for desktop application design. Also becoming familiar with the latest features of C# 10 and .NET 6
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 Those who know me know how to reach me. :-)
